# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection
This project focuses on detecting melanoma skin cancer using images from the ISIC 2018 Dataset. Leveraging the power of computer vision and deep learning, the model predicts whether an uploaded skin lesion image is benign or malignant.

The application has been deployed on Streamlit, providing an interactive interface for users to upload images and view predictions, making it accessible and user-friendly.

# Features
- Utilizes the ISIC 2018 dataset for training and evaluation.
- Implements state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for image classification.
- Detects whether a skin lesion is benign or malignant with high accuracy.
- Deployed on Streamlit for seamless interaction and visual representation of results.

# Technologies Used
* Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch
* Dataset: ISIC 2018 (International Skin Imaging Collaboration)
* Deployment Platform: Streamlit

# How It Works
* Upload an Image: Users can upload an image of a skin lesion.
* Preprocessing: The image is processed to match the input requirements of the model.
* Prediction: The trained model analyzes the image and classifies it as benign or malignant.
* Output: The result is displayed on the Streamlit app with a visual indication of the prediction.Acknowledgments
