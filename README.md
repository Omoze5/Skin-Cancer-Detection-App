# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection
This project focuses on detecting melanoma skin cancer using images from the ISIC 2018 Dataset. Leveraging the power of computer vision and deep learning, the model predicts whether an uploaded skin lesion image is benign or malignant.

The application has been deployed on Streamlit, providing an interactive interface for users to upload images and view predictions, making it accessible and user-friendly.
